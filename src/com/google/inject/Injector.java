/**
 * Fulfills requests for the object instances that make up your
 * application, always ensuring that these instances are properly injected
 * before they are returned.  The Injector is the heart of the Guice framework,
 * although you don't typically interact with it directly very often.  This
 * "behind-the-scenes" operation is what distinguishes the Dependency Injection
 * pattern from its cousin, Service Locator.
 *
 * <p>The Injector API has a few additional features: it allows pre-constructed
 * instances to have their fields and methods injected, and offers programmatic
 * introspection to support tool development.
 *
 * <p>Contains several default bindings:
 *
 * <ul>
 * <li>This {@link Injector} instance itself
 * <li>A {@code Provider<T>} for each binding of type {@code T}
 * <li>The {@link java.util.logging.Logger} for the class being injected
 * <li>The {@link Stage} in which the Injector was created
 * </ul>
 *
 * Injectors are created using the facade class {@link Guice}.
